•	20/08/2023 Started project and began research into AES encryption and cryptography
•	27/08/2023 Performed research into various methods of implementation and decided on FPGA
•	01/09/2023 Started developing Verilog skills with guides, tutorials, and books
•	20/09/2023 University started
•	01/10/2023 Recorded down the processes of all AES-128
•	05/10/2023 Using decomposition, broke down the processes into key modules and created design specifications for each one
•	07/10/2023 Began implementation
•	08/10/2023 Designed specifications for the expected inputs and outputs
•	10/10/2023 Started the main module to take in input, outputs and call the main modules
•	13/10/2023 Finished designing the main module
•	15/10/2023 Created the skeleton code for the decryption and encryption modules, and to declare all inputs and outputs to the modules
•	20/10/2023 Began work on the key scheduler module
•	25/10/2023 Started the key operations module within the key scheduler module
•	27/10/2023 Created the subWords submodule for the key operation module
