# AES128-FPGA
Implementing AES128-cbc with Verilog on an FPGA to encrypt and decrypt data

Following industry cryptography standards, it performs complex mathematical processes, revolving around binary matrix operations using Verilog

Runs a key scheduler under the main key management module to ensure that for every round of encryption, the key changes, as a countermeasure to cryptanalysis methods such as slide attacks

Highlights modules and the key processes of encryption and decryption processes

I undertook this project to both increase my proficiency in verilog and working with FPGAs, as well as learn to implement AES encryption
